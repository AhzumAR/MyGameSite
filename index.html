    <h2>A Study of <i>Call of Duty: Warzone</i> A game based on a battle royale where the last team standing wins!</h2>
  <br>This sight will highlight key aspects of warzone, starting with the audio. This audio will be what it sounds like to win a match of battle royale.</br>
  <br><audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="WarzoneWin.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio></br>
  <br>This is the sound that plays when you win the game. Its considered one of the most premium achievement. </br>
  <br> Winning a match means you have won the battle against many teams all working for the same goal. </br>
  <br> This audio is very significant becasue the match can get very hectic and you never know when its over until the audio queue of the win plays</br>

  <br>This shows many aspects of the game. one of them being that the game can get tense at any moment.</br>
    <br> As every team is fighing for the win, it doesnt matter if youre a solo, your team is down or if you have no loot.
    Players show no remorse. Warzone drops you into a huge map where you gotta loot fast, find plates, grab cash, and just survive while the gas keeps pushing everyone closer.
    If your team gets wiped it’s not done yet, you can still fight your way to a buy and clutch them back, but every gunshot puts a target on you.
    At the end it’s really just about making the right moves, winning your fights, and staying alive longer than everyone else.
