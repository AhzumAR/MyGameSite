<br>This website presents a study of the game Call of Duty Warzone. 

Call of Duty: Warzone is a free to play shooter where a bunch of players drop into one huge map and try to be the last person or team alive. You start with almost nothing and have to loot guns, armor, and money around the map. Where you land really matters because some spots are packed with people but have better loot, while other spots are safer but slower.

The main battle royale part is the gas circle that keeps closing in. If you stay outside it you start taking damage, so everyone is forced to move and fight instead of hiding all game. When you die the first time you go to the Gulag where you 1v1 someone for a chance to come back, which makes every death feel way more intense.

Warzone is also about teamwork and money. You can buy your teammates back, get better gear, and plan pushes together. In the end it’s not just about kills, it’s about surviving smart and making it to the last circle. </br>

    <h2>A Study of <i>Call of Duty: Warzone</i> A game based on a battle royale where the last team standing wins!</h2>
  <br>This sight will highlight key aspects of warzone, starting with the audio. This audio will be what it sounds like to win a match of battle royale.</br>
  <br><audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="WarzoneWin.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio></br>
  <br>This is the sound that plays when you win the game. Its considered one of the most premium achievement. </br>
  <br> Winning a match means you have won the battle against many teams all working for the same goal. </br>
  <br> This audio is very significant becasue the match can get very hectic and you never know when its over until the audio queue of the win plays</br>
<br>Having heard the sounds, now listen and look to how the visual works with the audio:</br>

  <br>The black and white color scheme and the strange, other-worldly appearance of this odd forest
  in which the boy is sleeping suggest a dystopic environment, a dreamscape, or some sort of
  world of the dead (note 2).</br>
<br>In case you think that finds others like him will provide a sense of community, think again:</br>

  <br>These are murderous kids and if the boy fears them, he has good reason, as you as user are about to find
  out.</br>
