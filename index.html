<br>This website presents a study of the game Call of Duty Warzone. 

Call of Duty: Warzone is a free to play shooter where a bunch of players drop into one huge map and try to be the last person or team alive. You start with almost nothing and have to loot guns, armor, and money around the map. Where you land really matters because some spots are packed with people but have better loot, while other spots are safer but slower.

The main battle royale part is the gas circle that keeps closing in. If you stay outside it you start taking damage, so everyone is forced to move and fight instead of hiding all game. When you die the first time you go to the Gulag where you 1v1 someone for a chance to come back, which makes every death feel way more intense.

Warzone is also about teamwork and money. You can buy your teammates back, get better gear, and plan pushes together. In the end it’s not just about kills, it’s about surviving smart and making it to the last circle. </br>
