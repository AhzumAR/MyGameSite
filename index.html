    <h2>A Study of <i>Call of Duty: Warzone</i> A game based on a battle royale where the last team standing wins!</h2>
  <br>This sight will highlight key aspects of warzone, starting with the audio. This audio will be what it sounds like to win a match of battle royale.</br>

  <br>This is the sound that plays when you win the game. Its considered one of the most premium achievement. </br>
  <br> Winning a match means you have won the battle against many teams all working for the same goal. </br>
  <br> This audio is very significant becasue the match can get very hectic and you never know when its over until the audio queue of the win plays</br>
<h2>After hearing the win sound, here is a visual edit of how tense these matches can get:</h2>

  <br>This shows many aspects of the game. one of them being that the game can get tense at any moment.</br>
    <br> As every team is fighing for the win, it doesnt matter if youre a solo, your team is down or if you have no loot.</br>
    <br>Players show no remorse. Warzone drops you into a huge map where you gotta loot fast, find plates, grab cash, and just survive while the gas keeps pushing everyone closer.</br>
    <br>If your team gets wiped it’s not done yet, you can still fight your way to a buy and clutch them back, but every gunshot puts a target on you.</br>
    <br>At the end it’s really just about making the right moves, winning your fights, and staying alive longer than everyone else.</br>
<h2>Overview of Warzone</h2>
<br><img src="Warzone.png"></br>
  <br> Warzone is a battle royale where you drop into a huge map, loot, rotate, and fight other squads while the circle closes.</br>
  <br>The main goal is simple: be the last team alive. But what makes it intense is how fast everything changes. one mistake
        can end your match, and one good play can flip everything.</br>
<h2>Narrative ARC</h2>
     <br>Even though Warzone isn’t a story game, every match has a narrative arc. It starts with the drop choosing a landing spot,</br>
      <br>grabbing loot, and surviving the first chaos. Then there’s the midgame where you build your “identity” in the match,</br>
      <br>your loadout, your playstyle (aggressive vs slow), and your plan. Late game is the climax, circles get smaller,</br>
      <br>positioning matters more than aim sometimes, and one third party can end everything. It’s basically a mini story of</br>
      <br>survival, adaptation, and pressure every single time.</br>
      <h2>Connection to a Course Reading</h2>
      <br>One idea that connects to Warzone is Barthes’ “reality effect,” where small details that don’t “need” to be there still</br>
      <br>make something feel real. In Warzone, the tiny stuff like distant shots, random footsteps, UAV pings, plates cracking,</br>
      <br>and all the little ambient cues don’t always matter structurally, but they make the match feel immediate and like you’re</br>
      <br>actually inside it. Even when nothing major is happening, those details keep your body on edge and make the experience</br>
      <br>feel real in the moment.</br>
    <h2>Conclusion (What Warzone Means to Me)</h2>
        <br>Warzone is compelling to me because it’s a mix of skill, chaos, and decision making. It’s not just aiming it’s reading</br>
        <br>situations, staying calm, and making smart plays under pressure. The best part is when everything clicks: your rotations</br>
        <br>are clean, your team is synced, and you win a fight you weren’t “supposed” to win. That feeling is why I keep coming back.</br>
