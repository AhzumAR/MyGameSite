    <h2>A Study of <i>Call of Duty: Warzone</i> A game based on a battle royale where the last team standing wins!</h2>
  <br>This sight will highlight key aspects of warzone, starting with the audio. This audio will be what it sounds like to win a match of battle royale.</br>
  <br><audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <source src="WarzoneWin.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio></br>
  <br>This is the sound that plays when you win the game. Its considered one of the most premium achievement. </br>
  <br> Winning a match means you have won the battle against many teams all working for the same goal. </br>
  <br> This audio is very significant becasue the match can get very hectic and you never know when its over until the audio queue of the win plays</br>
<h2>After hearing the win sound, here is a visual edit of how tense these matches can get:</h2>

  <br>This shows many aspects of the game. one of them being that the game can get tense at any moment.</br>
    <br> As every team is fighing for the win, it doesnt matter if youre a solo, your team is down or if you have no loot.</br>
    <br>Players show no remorse. Warzone drops you into a huge map where you gotta loot fast, find plates, grab cash, and just survive while the gas keeps pushing everyone closer.</br>
    <br>If your team gets wiped it’s not done yet, you can still fight your way to a buy and clutch them back, but every gunshot puts a target on you.</br>
    <br>At the end it’s really just about making the right moves, winning your fights, and staying alive longer than everyone else.</br>
<h2>Overview of Warzone</h2>
<br><img src="limbo.others.two.png"> (note 3)</br>
  <br> Warzone is a battle royale where you drop into a huge map, loot, rotate, and fight other squads while the circle closes.</br>
  <br>The main goal is simple: be the last team alive. But what makes it intense is how fast everything changes. one mistake
        can end your match, and one good play can flip everything.</br>
<h2>Narrative ARC</h2>
     <br>Even though Warzone isn’t a story game, every match has a narrative arc. It starts with the drop choosing a landing spot,</br>
      <br>grabbing loot, and surviving the first chaos. Then there’s the midgame where you build your “identity” in the match,</br>
      <br>your loadout, your playstyle (aggressive vs slow), and your plan. Late game is the climax, circles get smaller,</br>
      <br>positioning matters more than aim sometimes, and one third party can end everything. It’s basically a mini story of</br>
      <br>survival, adaptation, and pressure every single time.</br>

      <h2>Connection to a Course Reading</h2>
      <p>
        One idea that connects to Warzone is Barthes’ “reality effect,” where small details that don’t “need” to be there still
        make something feel real. In Warzone, the tiny stuff like distant shots, random footsteps, UAV pings, plates cracking,
        and all the little ambient cues don’t always matter structurally, but they make the match feel immediate and like you’re
        actually inside it. Even when nothing major is happening, those details keep your body on edge and make the experience
        feel real in the moment.
