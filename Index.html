<br>This website presents a study of the game LIMBO.</br>
<br>LIMBO uses a monochromatic visual style to create a dark and atmospheric mood.</br>
<br>The game relies on environmental storytelling rather than dialogue.</br>
<br>Players must solve physics-based puzzles to progress through the world.</br>
<br>Trial and error is a core mechanic that teaches the player through failure.</br>
<br>Sound design and silence are used to increase tension and immersion.</br>
<br>The game encourages careful observation and slow, deliberate movement.</br>
